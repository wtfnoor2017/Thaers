"Atop her thorny throne-<br>The moth as a queen of the quiet conquest.<br>My hand has been scarred from such sickly sentiment,<br>A nail buried within the layer of stone and silk.<br><br>A giant sleeps within the plains,<br>A litter of crackling graves and crusted crosses<br>From her spine comes the line of grief,<br>From her cloak comes the cost of parting.<br><br>Merely mothers to our fallen trees-<br>Our regret of clinging comes in the quickening anguish of the end.",

"Thy slumber has filled with the metal hum of those glaring giants,<br>Through the ashy birth of night.<br>From flames was given,<br>Such wondrous gifts of knowing-<br>The prophecy of our shifting patterns<br>From the candle in the dark comes a seed of wind,<br>A splinter of smoke,<br>Slipping within the vein-<br>Breaking into the veil.",

"Peering within the glass are the doors-<br>The paths of reflection,<br>Our foretelling fractals.<br><br>â€  Shall we walk within the arms of the arches?<br>Shall we reach our pointed temple,<br>hiding behind its misty mask?<br><br>Scratching our symbols into the sand,<br>Slowly weaving into the wind,<br>Spinning,<br> through the spiral stairways.",

"My lull is swimming in those soft rays,<br><br>Sinking into the skin of mine,<br><br>Shimmering within these fruitless veins.<br><br>Mother I wish,<br><br>To cease the floods of fire-<br></br>To halt the horns of dawn and sleep,<br><br>Inside the cradle of your crescent-<br><br>O mother I wish<br><br>",


"The band of crows comes to creep,<br><br> crowned with their darkness-<br><br>A heavenly contagion.<br><br>For fools only withdraw from the bind of this silent grace,<br><br>This marriage in hiding.<br><br>Creep from beneath beloved,<br><br>Screech from the bowel of the airs<br><br>Seek me out-<br><br>From below the mirrors of your winged eyes.<br><br>",



"Cradled within the knights palm lie the cursed note-<br><br>The broken wing of whiteness.<br><br>Forsaken in the vines of knowledge we are,<br><br>Content with the plague of lightness<br><br>If the eyes be mine, where might I find such insight of kindness for the shadow? <br><br>Thy teeth are weary,<br><br>Thy robe is torn, <br><br>From a bridge I fall, <br><br>Into the womb of such misty streams.<br><br>",


"What savage cruelty comes from the hiss of morning,<br>From our illness of existence?<br><br>In the senseless chamber we must go,<br>Cracking into the dust of the forgotten hum.<br><br>Where be my chainless kingdom?<br>O mighty darkness where might I find your skin?<br><br>Twisting within a crushing darkness-<br>Spiraling beneath the swirls of snakes.<br><br>My rot, ceased within the ravaging rays of midsummer.<br>",

"Fierce breathing behind the black bushes- a signal of our shocking hour. From the winter comes the coldest killing, we must prepare for this beloved ending.<br></br> Torn away from the gripping cage, we must sacrifice our siren song for the lulling moon. Those who reject such a gentle call shall not be spared from the edge of the spear. The grounds might quake in midday- before the moon meets my eyes once more, if that be the end, I must shed the shell of my outward face.",



"Decaying in the dust is the fire from my lonesome soul. I held the burning hand in destruction and crossed the path behind the black mountain.<br></br> An echo booms in the mist and I join my shadow under the lulling light. The moon sings a song as a whistle in the dark and I submit to this monarch in midnight. Below the void I am visited by my form in this otherworld. A mystical sense of binding must be, a mythical sense of seeking. <br></br>The cypress path reflects within me- through the scrying glass.",

"My love-my savior in the darkness. I have reached for you in the ash of tonight with a burning sincerity. May my voice have been heard from the chamber of the bounday and bounce from the walls of my peering mouth.<br></br><b> I have torn an eye from the veiled skin on my bones</b><br></br> With this eye I might seek into your creeping hole of darknesss. <br></br>I touch the face of my beloved priestess and take her hand through the barren burial as we dance beneath the weeping moon- and I with her, forevermore.",


"<i>Burn, burn, burn.</i> Smoke from a million dusk come my way. Running through the halls of that eternal ending.<br></br> Hand in hand with the eye that molds me. <br></br> Under the void in <br></br>b<br></br>i<br></br>r<br></br>t<br></br>h<br></br><b>...</b>",

"Crystals form from the shaking acid- our form in the darkness of tomorrow.<br></br> I shake tonight as my armor cracks under the moon and must I say, we are near the end.",

"Sounds across the quaking fire, and my beloved fumes sleep before me",

"In the white field there was a rotting cross, with scattered sword and burning shield I cast my hand upon the cracking grounds.",

"All of you are mice crawling up the rotting mountain,<br></br> For I cannot be among those creatures who bleed with greed and hunger<br></br>Rising from the pits of the dark hour, <br></br>Children of the bound mother.<br></br>Cracks come from the clay that molds us.<br></br>Your shadow drags beneath the feet of the sun<br></br>You are the purgers<br></br>Blind soulless creatures<br></br>If you must,<br></br>Search for the pure white light you seeking monsters,<br></br>Find the empty path whom none walk,<br></br>Forget the strings that bind you.",

"It is that darkness that holds us and binds us-Not that sun. Allow yourself to be touched by that- darkness by that distorted figure."
